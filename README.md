# Sequent Calculus and Tableaux Resolution Method

Implementation of the Sequent Calculus and Tableaux Resolution Method for Propositional Logic: the proof of a sequent gets visualized through a LaTeX file that can be converted to an image or included verbatim in a document while a tableaux resolution gets compiled to Graphviz's language and rendered with "dot".  
Code based on the books:
* A Course in Mathematical Logic - J. L. Bell, M. Machover
* Logic for Computer Science: Foundations of Automatic Theorem Proving - Jean H. Gallier

Needs: [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/), LaTeX, Paul Taylor's [Proof Trees](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/generic/proofs/taylor/), Charles Plager's [tex2png.pl](http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/~cplager/latex/).
